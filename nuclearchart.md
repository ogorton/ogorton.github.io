# Shell model dimensions

by [Oliver Gorton](index.html)

These figures show the dimensions of M-scheme shell model calculations in
various valence spaces. Dimensions were computed with the
[BIGSTICK](https://github.com/cwjsdsu/BigstickPublick) shell model code.
Figures were generated with a Python script that writes gnuplot code.  In
spaces with both parities, dimenions include both.

Gaps in the chart indicate magic numbers according to the conventional shell model:

The edges of the chart are given by the intersection of the model space (a
rectangular region) and the drip line according to the NNDC. The squares with a
thicker border are the stable isotopes.
