# Shell model dimensions

by Oliver Gorton

These figures show the dimensions of M-scheme shell model calculations in
various valence spaces. Dimensions were computed with the
[BIGSTICK](https://github.com/cwjsdsu/BigstickPublick) shell model code.
Figures were generated with a Python script that writes gnuplot code.
In spaces with both parities, dimenions include both.
