## Summary

Ph.D. Candidate from San Diego State University and University of California, 
Irvine, currently at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory

I use scientific computing to study the structure and properties of atomic
nuclei. I have worked on a number of different topics in nuclear
structure and reaction theory, quantum chemistry, quantum information theory,
and machine learning. All of my work involves the application of high
performance computing (HPC) to quantum many-body physics.

My (ongoing) Ph.D. project is on the integrated shell model and Hauser-Feshbach
description of beta-delayed neutron emission.
